# SolarEcology
For over 10,000 years, the story of solar has been the story of society. We argue that solar energy must be addressed as a transformative, transdisciplinary framework for nexus research and adaptive design: solar ecology; with rich opportunities motivated by the need to understand our local regimes and pose sustainable adaption planning given a climate changed by 2100. We present the solar ecology framework for research and design at the interface of ecosystems and society.
